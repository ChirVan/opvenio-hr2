# Employee Data Architecture Change

## Overview
The Gap Analysis system has been updated to use external employee data from an API instead of a local employees table.

## Important Changes

### Database Structure
- **Before**: `employee_id` in `gap_analyses` table had a foreign key constraint referencing local `employees.id`
- **After**: `employee_id` now stores the external API employee ID (no foreign key constraint)

### Employee Data Source
- **Before**: Employee data from `competency_management.employees` table
- **After**: Employee data from external API: `https://hr4.microfinancial-1.com/services/hcm-services/public/employees`

### API Employee Fields Used
- `id` - External employee ID (stored in gap_analyses.employee_id)
- `employee_id` - Employee identification number (e.g., "EMP-001")
- `full_name` - Complete employee name
- `email` - Employee email address
- `employment_status` - Active/Inactive status
- `job_title` - Employee job position

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration
- Removed foreign key constraint from `gap_analyses.employee_id`
- Added `assessment_date` and `status` columns
- Migration: `2025_10_04_214500_remove_employee_foreign_key_from_gap_analyses.php`

### 2. Model Updates
- Updated `GapAnalysis` model fillable fields
- Added `getEmployeeData()` method to fetch from external API
- Removed local employee relationship

### 3. Controller Updates
- `GapAnalysisController` now uses `EmployeeApiService`
- Validates employee existence in external API before saving
- Merges gap analysis data with external employee data for display

### 4. Form Updates
- Create form now shows external API employees
- Employee selection shows API employee data
- Form validation updated for external employee IDs

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Data Integrity**: The `employee_id` field in `gap_analyses` table now stores external API employee IDs. Ensure the external API is reliable and accessible.

⚠️ **No Local Employee Table**: The local `employees` table in `competency_management` database is no longer used for gap analysis.

⚠️ **API Dependency**: Gap analysis functionality depends on external API availability. Proper error handling is implemented for API failures.

## Usage

### Creating Gap Analysis
```php
// Employee ID comes from external API
$gapAnalysis = GapAnalysis::create([
    'employee_id' => 1, // External API employee ID
    'competency_id' => 5,
    'framework' => 'Leadership Framework',
    'proficiency_level' => 'Intermediate',
    'notes' => 'Assessment notes',
    'assessment_date' => '2025-10-04',
    'status' => 'pending'
]);
```

### Getting Employee Data
```php
// Get employee data for a gap analysis record
$gapAnalysis = GapAnalysis::find(1);
$employeeData = $gapAnalysis->getEmployeeData();
// Returns: ['id' => 1, 'employee_id' => 'EMP-001', 'full_name' => 'John Doe', ...]
```

## Training Assignment Integration

### Database Structure
- **training_assignments**: Main assignment table (no employee_id here)
- **training_assignment_employees**: Junction table with external API employee_id (no foreign key constraint)

### Key Changes
- Updated `TrainingAssignmentEmployee` model to use `getEmployeeData()` method
- Removed problematic `employee()` relationship from model
- Updated controller to remove `.employee` relationship loading
- Enhanced success messages to show employee information from API

### Usage in Training Assignments
```php
// Get employee data for assignment
$assignmentEmployee = TrainingAssignmentEmployee::find(1);
$employeeData = $assignmentEmployee->getEmployeeData();
// Returns: ['id' => 1, 'employee_id' => 'EMP-001', 'full_name' => 'John Doe', ...]
```
