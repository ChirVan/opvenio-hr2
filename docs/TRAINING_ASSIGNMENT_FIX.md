# Training Assignment Bug Fix

## Issue Fixed
**Error**: "Attempt to read property 'job_role' on null"
**Location**: `resources/views/training_management/assign.blade.php` line 165

## Root Cause
The view was trying to access `$assignmentEmployee->employee->job_role` but the `employee()` relationship was removed when we migrated to external API employee data.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Controller Updates
- **TrainingAssignmentController**: Updated `index()` and `show()` methods to fetch employee data from external API
- **Helper Method**: Added `getEmployeesData()` method to avoid code duplication
- **Data Passing**: Both methods now pass `$employeesData` array to the view

### 2. View Updates
- **assign.blade.php**: Updated employee display logic to use API data instead of removed relationship
- **Enhanced Display**: Now shows full employee information including:
  - Full name
  - Employee ID
  - Job title
  - Email address
  - Employment status (with color-coded badges)
- **Error Handling**: Displays "Employee not found" message if API data is missing

### 3. Code Structure
```php
// Controller fetches employee data
$employeeIds = $assignments->flatMap(function($assignment) {
    return $assignment->assignmentEmployees->pluck('employee_id');
})->unique()->toArray();

$employeesData = $this->getEmployeesData($employeeIds);

// View uses the data
@php
    $employee = isset($employeesData) ? ($employeesData[$assignmentEmployee->employee_id] ?? null) : null;
@endphp
```

## Result
- ✅ Training assignment list page now works without errors
- ✅ Employee information displays correctly from external API
- ✅ Enhanced employee details with better formatting
- ✅ Proper error handling for missing employee data
