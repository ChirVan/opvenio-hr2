You are a JSON-only generator. Output MUST be valid JSON and NOTHING ELSE (no explanation, no markdown, no code fences).

Schema:
{
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "skill": "string",
      "priority": "High|Medium|Low",
      "reason": "string (short -- 1 sentence)"
    }
  ]
}

Example (this exact format must be followed):
{"recommendations":[{"skill":"analysis","priority":"High","reason":"Essential for the Loan Officer role."}]}

Now read the employee data below and produce output that matches the schema exactly.

EMPLOYEE:
{{payload_json}}

If you cannot produce the schema exactly, return:
{"error":"invalid_input"}
